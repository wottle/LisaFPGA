set_false_path -to [get_cells io_board/READ_ACK_COP_int_reg]
## Also false-path the COP data bus (both directions); we can't put a synchronizer on it because of inter-bit skew, but syncing the handshake signals is enough
set_false_path -to [get_cells {io_board/kbd_via/port_a_c_reg[*]}]
set_false_path -to [get_cells {io_board/L_COP_out_reg[*]}]

## There's an annoying DRC rule during implementation that gives us an error if we try to drive 3 or more MMCMs from one IBUF
## You can do it, but the MMCMs have to placed in certain places relative to the IBUF, which doesn't work out for us
## So to get around this, we tell Vivado to ignore the rule for our sysclk
## This would be bad for a clock that was actively clocking a ton of logic, but since we're only using this clock to feed MMCMs, it's fine
## The MMCMs will get rid of any skew that would be generated by this violation anyway
set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE BACKBONE [get_nets sysclk_ibuf]
## Yet another annoying rule exists for the BUFGMUX/BUFGCTRL primitives used for clock muxing
## If you daisy-chain muxes, they have to be placed adjacent to each other in the same CMT column, but we have 3 of them and it's impossible
## So we again tell Vivado to ignore the rule for our dot clock nets; it's fine once again since nobody cares if the intermediate clocks have skew
set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE ANY_CMT_COLUMN [get_nets dotck_A]
set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE ANY_CMT_COLUMN [get_nets dotck_B]

## Based on the pins we used for our HDMI output, the OSERDES primitives for TMDS encoding are in a particular part of the FPGA
## And to avoid violating some design rules, we have to put the MMCM that feeds the OSERDES in that same part (X0Y2)
## But by default, Vivado tries to put the primary clock divider MMCM there instead, so force it into X0Y0 and put our HDMI MMCM in X0Y2
set_property LOC MMCME2_ADV_X0Y2 [get_cells lisa_hdmi_output/hdmi_clock_generator/inst/mmcm_adv_inst]
set_property LOC MMCME2_ADV_X0Y0 [get_cells primary_clock_divider/inst/mmcm_adv_inst]
## We don't explicitly place the 1024x768 MMCM (hdmi_clock_generator_1024x768) anywhere -- it also feeds the same
## OSERDES via the BUFGMUXes below, but only at 65/325MHz (vs. 148.5/742.5MHz for the stock clocks), so there's much
## more timing margin to work with even if the placer doesn't put it as close to the OSERDES as X0Y2. If Timing Summary
## ever shows trouble specifically on the clk_pixel_1024x768/clk_pixel_x5_1024x768 domains, an explicit LOC in whichever
## CMT column is free may be needed here too.

## Place the RAM board in the clock region directly adjacent to the SRAM I/O pins (X1Y1) to ensure that the SRAM interface is as fast as possible
## Certain unluckily-slow SRAM chips can be borderline too slow to work properly at a 75MHz DOTCK if we don't do this
## First, create a pblock to contain all of the logic for the RAM board
create_pblock MEM_PBLOCK
## And then add all of the RAM board (slot1) logic to it
add_cells_to_pblock [get_pblocks MEM_PBLOCK] [get_cells {slot1}]
## Then finally, stick it in the X1Y1 clock region
resize_pblock [get_pblocks MEM_PBLOCK] -add {CLOCKREGION_X1Y1:CLOCKREGION_X1Y1}

## Another thing for the SRAM interface: we need to set max delays for the SRAM signals to ensure that the SRAM has enough time to respond
## These max delays tell the Vivado how long of a path it's allowed to take when routing the SRAM signals internally
## And a timing violation is generated if it fails to route them as fast as our delay allows
## This way, we can set the max internal delay well below the 75MHz DOTCK period of 13-ish ns, and that ensures that there's still plenty of time for the signals to propagate outside the FPGA
## The datapath_only option means that we don't care about setup/hold timing here in relation to any clocks, just the raw routing delay
## Which is exactly what we want given that the SRAM is asynchronous
set_max_delay -datapath_only 6.0 -to [get_ports _CE_SRAM _OE_SRAM _WE_SRAM _UDS_SRAM _LDS_SRAM {A_SRAM[*]} {D_SRAM[*]}]

## We also need to declare some false paths related to our clock muxing
## This is because only one of the clocks is actually active at a time, so timing analysis between the 4 dot clocks is pointless
## Instead of a billion false path constraints, we can instead just make an exclusive clock group for the 4 DOTCKs
## This is just a single line, and tells Vivado that these clocks are all mutually exclusive and should be analyzed as such
set_clock_groups -name exclusive_dotcks -logically_exclusive -group dotck_20M_dotck_mmcm -group dotck_40M_dotck_mmcm -group dotck_60M_dotck_mmcm -group dotck_80M_dotck_mmcm

## It's also impossible to go between the 1080p30 and 1080p60 pixel clocks and the x5 pixel clocks, so make exclusive clock groups for them too
## (These clocks always exist on the MMCMs regardless of OUTPUT_1024X768 -- see HDMI_Interface.sv -- so this constraint is unconditional.
## clk_pixel_1024x768/clk_pixel_x5_1024x768 come from a separate MMCM than the other four now, but the group names are unaffected
## since Vivado names these clocks after their IP output port, which we kept identical when we split them out.)
## NOTE on the 1024x768 clock names: Vivado auto-derives these from the MMCM and names them
## "<output_port>_<ip_instance>", i.e. clk_pixel_1024x768_hdmi_clock_divider_1024x768 -- NOT the bare port
## name (the same suffixing you can see on dotck_20M_dotck_mmcm above). Naming them bare makes the group
## silently match nothing, and the whole point of these constraints is lost: without them Vivado times paths
## BETWEEN the 1080p and 1024x768 domains through the BUFGMUXes, which can never both be live, producing
## thousands of phantom violations. Matching with a get_clocks wildcard instead of a hardcoded name so this
## keeps working if the derived name changes.
## Which of these clocks actually EXIST depends on the build: in an OUTPUT_1024X768 build the 1080p60 taps
## are unused (the BUFGMUX's second input is the 1024x768 clock instead), so no clk_pixel_1080p60 clock is
## derived at all; in a stock build it's the 1024x768 clocks that go unused. Naming a nonexistent clock makes
## the whole set_clock_groups silently match nothing, so build the group list from whatever is really present.
## Wildcards matter too: Vivado names the 1024x768 clocks "<port>_<ip_instance>"
## (clk_pixel_1024x768_hdmi_clock_divider_1024x768), not the bare port name.
## *** IMPORTANT XDC LIMITATION ***: this Vivado rejects BOTH 'proc' AND 'if' inside an .xdc file
## ("[Designutils 20-1307] Command 'if' is not supported in the xdc constraint file") -- and it does so as a
## CRITICAL WARNING that does NOT fail the run, so anything inside such a block silently never applies. Do not
## use control flow here; write plain unconditional constraints only. (A .tcl file added to the constraints
## fileset instead of an .xdc would allow full Tcl, if conditional constraints are ever really needed.)
##
## Since we can't branch on build type, declare BOTH exclusive pairs unconditionally and let get_clocks -quiet
## return nothing for whichever pair doesn't exist in this build. The pair that can't resolve logs a benign
## 12-4739 "no valid object(s)" critical warning and applies nothing; the other one binds normally.
##   - stock build      -> clk_pixel_1080p60 exists,  clk_pixel_1024x768* does not
##   - OUTPUT_1024X768  -> clk_pixel_1024x768* exists, clk_pixel_1080p60 does not
## Vivado names the 1024x768 clocks "<port>_<ip_instance>" (clk_pixel_1024x768_hdmi_clock_divider_1024x768),
## NOT the bare port name, hence the trailing wildcards.

## The 1024x768 MMCM's two output BUFGs feed the pixel-clock BUFGMUXes below, forming a BUFG->BUFG cascade.
## Vivado's rule_cascaded_bufg wants those adjacent and cyclic, but (unlike hdmi_clock_divider, which is LOC'd
## to MMCME2_ADV_X0Y2 near the OSERDES) this MMCM floats, so the placer put its BUFGs down at BUFGCTRL_X0Y8/Y9
## while the muxes landed at X0Y20/Y21 -- not adjacent, so placement failed. Same situation and same workaround
## as the dotck_A/dotck_B daisy-chained mux nets above; nobody cares if these intermediate clocks have skew.
## NOTE: these nets are INSIDE the IP instance ("<ip_instance>/inst/<port_name>"), not at the HDMI_Interface

## Create a constraint for our 48KHz audio clock

## Parallel SRAM Interface
## Ensure all of the SRAM pins have a fast slew rate instead of the default of slow and set them all to the max drive strength of 12mA
## We have to do this because our 55ns SRAM is borderline too slow to work at a 75MHz DOTCK, so we need the fastest I/O we can possibly get
